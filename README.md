# operating-system-knowledge

## Overview
Collect the knowledge of operating system for tech interview.

## Knowledge

   - [Program](knowledge/Program_Process_Thread_Coroutine.md#program)
   - [Process](knowledge/Program_Process_Thread_Coroutine.md#process)
   - [Thread](knowledge/Program_Process_Thread_Coroutine.md#thread)
   - [Coroutine](knowledge/Program_Process_Thread_Coroutine.md#coroutine)
   - [Comparison](knowledge/Program_Process_Thread_Coroutine.md#comparison)
   - [Process vs. Thread](knowledge/Program_Process_Thread_Coroutine.md#process-vs-thread)
   - [Coroutine vs. Thread](knowledge/Program_Process_Thread_Coroutine.md#coroutine-vs-thread)
